## About

**HACKMAN** <br />
**Code is our canvas, innovation is our paint** <br />
**Date : June 4th - 5th**



HackMan v.6 is an Inter College, extravagant 24-hours Hackathon, hosted by the Department of ISE, Dayananda Sagar College of Engineering (DSCE), Bangalore. We give the brightest of minds a chance to brainstorm as a team and come up with unique solutions, code it out and solve some of the pressing problems of our society. Over the first 4 versions we have seen some brilliant projects and we challenge you to top them off with your Out-of-the-box ideas. 


**“You can't solve a problem on the same level that it was created. You have to rise above it to the next level.”**
